# UCB_AI-ML_20.1_Capstone_Initial_Report_EDA

## 🧠 Executive Summary
This project investigates how user behavior around book ratings can be used to uncover distinct groups of readers using unsupervised learning. The focus is on clustering users into interpretable segments to enable more personalized book recommendations and strategic content targeting.

## 🎯 Rationale
Understanding how readers interact with books through their ratings can lead to more engaging digital experiences. This type of analysis allows for data-driven content recommendations and better user segmentation in publishing and educational platforms.

## ❓ Research Question
Can we cluster users based on interpretable features extracted from their book rating behavior to uncover distinct reader segments?

## 💾 Data Sources 
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: [Book Recommendation System with Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/code/midouazerty/book-recommendation-system-with-machine-learning/input). It contains:
- User IDs
- Book ratings
- Book metadata (titles, authors, etc.)

We're using a preprocessed version (that combines three CSV files into one) saved as a zipped CSV (`Preprocessed_data.csv.zip`).

## 🧪 Methodology
- Feature extraction from book ratings (e.g., average rating, frequency)
- Dimensionality reduction using SFS or PCA
- Clustering using unsupervised learning techniques such as K-Means and DBSCAN
- Visual exploration and interpretation of user clusters

## 🧭 Expected Results/Results
The project aims to identify user clusters based on rating behaviors, such as preferences for certain genres or rating patterns (e.g., frequent raters vs. rare raters). The clusters will be visualized to evaluate separation and meaning, supporting potential personalized strategies in content platforms.
